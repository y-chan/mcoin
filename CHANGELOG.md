# Bcoin Release Notes & Changelog

## v1.0.0-beta.14

### Notable Changes

- __pkg__ - Ignored `bcoin*` files in npmignore have been removed. This fixes
  the npm install.

## v1.0.0-beta.13

### Notable Changes

- __config__ - Options using megabyte units are now calculated properly again
  (6182df044228f9215938e7d314435f3f2640acca,
  a630d23a97b68f189a85105856fedc4e9e515754,
  7728a0047053d4c368e60426e5fc7cc812d54caf).

- __address__ - Bech32 addresses are now supported
  (6acef06cbc87a3051ba238a2fb640562e718135e). This changes the semantics of
  the `Address` object: to support bech32, `Address.fromBase58` calls should be
  replaced with `Address.fromString`.  Likewise, `addr.toBase58` calls should
  be replaced with `addr.toString`

- __rpc__ - `getblockbyheight` is now exposed via JSON-RPC. It takes the same
  parameters as the `getblock` call, requiring a height instead of block hash
  (12d3ee6f9582afa9a3ba8984c63dcbc27b8db57e).

- __bin__ - `bcoin --version` and `bcoin --help` now exit with appropriate
  messages (f2f94a800e37c5dbdda6920fa6b85fbd485c212a).

- __net__ - The p2p pool now exposes an `--only` option
  (a1d0948f2e528c5d77d6502659fafd064b1e693b).

- __mempool__ - The mempool `indexAddress` option should now work correctly
  (fba9b46d253c19bbf8e662d9d75ab03dc9e20a78).

- __rpc__ - JSON-RPC calls now properly cast booleans a la bitcoin core
  (dd49ee076196d2353783e3044185165dbac4aeb9).

- __rpc__ - Various RPC calls have been improved and updated
  (c78707ed6a71ce46c41c4e43ecb505e78a84b380,
  c1e684dc12d0a86573a905d54d4f81fce921987a,
  5bde338a53117b1bd0fd92df0abc23d95180ab32).

- __rpc__ - Retroactive pruning is now available via the `pruneblockchain` call
  (f0bc6d5925419ba4a8289fa7828efc48ecc152d4).

- __http__ - Getting block by height via the Rest API now works again
  (df4c8cc68c965bd818a5004354d2652751d4a702).

- __net__ - Peers who serve invalid orphans are now punished properly
  (0ceca23cb5a3d724c79c6bf587ede5d473df8486).

- __utils__ - An implementation of GCS filters is now supported
  (b994c278f25408886c3095d0c24123baaf07f78f).

- __http__ - The `witness` option is now properly exposed on the Rest API for
  segwit wallets (f04ad612b216becd35765c6e231f7820c7eee358).

- __deps__ - Node.js >=v7.6.0 is now a required dependency
  (a0bd9680fed07c5eb37c227d160b0868f8adaf31).

- __build__ - The browser build has switched from browserify to webpack
  (19f236f74072d473123d20282d2119f6d9130458).

- __bcoin__ - The codebase has been rewritten to use all ES6 and ES7 features
  supported by node.js
  (aa05bb5df79d9a3af53060a4c0c066226f6e9e4c,
  78d62c73b82e1953999d1cf80c90ed2035d4996e,
  e00472891df5934d8fc3aa63662f852816aa86b0,
  c53f4cf89e46d9de8ab7f65430310567558fe03f,
  8c7279518f5341a2482a79ac98f0574468541edc).

- __workers__ - The worker pool has been refactored to solve the dissonance
  between the browser and node.js (27c60ce76e57af1695d78f912227d93194812c88).

- __net__ - DNS requests should now timeout sooner
  (647b6909c6d527eb82f6d789c88a23b2f8a60126).

- __http__ - Satoshi values are now required for all JSON serialization, as
  opposed to BTC strings which were used in the past
  (2f51fd1c5066f194a5a52383f4dd45497b882706).

- __bin__ - The `--no-wallet` flag is now exposed for nodes who want to run
  without a wallet.

- __chain__ - BIP91 support is now exposed via the `--bip91` option.  The
  `segwit` and `segsignal` rules will be automatically added when calling
  `getblocktemplate`. To enable bip91 on an existing database `--force-flags`
  must be passed. This will force bip91 to be enforced, but will not invalidate
  any previous blocks (`bcoin cli reset [height]` may need to be used).

- __chain__ - BIP148 support is now exposed via the `--bip148` option. This
  likewise must be enabled with `--force-flags` on existing chains. This has
  the same potential "reset" implications as the `--bip91` option.

### Migrating

This release contains a few non-backward-compatible changes.

Bcoin now requires node.js >=7.6.0 due to the use of ES6/7 features, and for
the sake of more stability.

Bcoin's rest API now assumes satoshi values for in all JSON serialization.
__This is a breaking change__ for code that is not aware of it. All code which
hits the rest API must be updated to use only satoshi values as opposed to BTC
strings.

In other words, this:

``` json
{
  "unconfirmed": "1.12",
  "confirmed": "1.12"
}
```

Becomes this:

``` json
{
  "unconfirmed": 112000000,
  "confirmed": 112000000
}
```

- __rpc__ - Several `getblocktemplate` improvements have been implemented for
  more accuracy. e.g. `curtime` will now be updated each call.

  stratum in a sense.
- __chain__ - Faster verification with checkpoints.
- __net__ - Fixed a potential block stalling issue.
- __net__ - Hardcoded seeds for main added. Makes
  for better shipping with browsers.
- __wsproxy/proxysocket__ - DNS resolution is no longer exposed.

  mempool.

## v1.0.0-beta.7

### Notable Changes

  non-contextual checks if necessary.
